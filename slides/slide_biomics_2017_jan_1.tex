  \begin{itemize}
  \item De novo and targeted sequencing of viruses, prokaryotes and eukaryotes
  \item Variant (SNP, indel, large rearrangements) detection
  \item Transcriptional analysis (RNA-Seq) for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes
  \item 16S and deep-sequencing metagenomic studies (mouse, human, and other
environments)
  \item Epigenetics (CHIP-Seq, methylation studies)
  \end{itemize}
